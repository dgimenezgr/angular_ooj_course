1. Pregunta 1

Consider the first version of GladLibs we saw in this lesson, which stores label substitutions in ArrayLists. Assume an ArrayList named wordsUsed will 
keep track of words used as replacements so no replacement word will be used more than once. The code below was used as part of a program by a learner 
in the method processWord. The learner's program runs but still results in duplicate words sometimes. 

RESPUESTA:

If a word is repeated a second call is made and no more checks.


2. Pregunta 2

Consider the first version of GladLibs we saw in this lesson, which you modified so there would not be duplicate words chosen for the story. Assume an 
instance variable is used to keep track of the total number of word tags that are replaced.
Which one of the following methods is most likely where that variable is updated? 

RESPUESTA:
processWord();


3. Pregunta 3
Consider the class WordFrequencies, which you wrote in an assignment, that can determine facts about words in a file.

RESPUESTA:
32


10. Pregunta 10

What is the number of occurrences of the codon that occurs the most often using a reading frame that starts at position 2?

RESPUESTA:
12


11. Pregunta 11

12. Pregunta 12
Consider the class WordsInFiles, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines which words occur in several files, and for each word, which files they occur in.
Consider the seven files: caesar.txt, confucius.txt, errors.txt, hamlet.txt, likeit.txt, macbeth.txt, and romeo.txt.
How many words are there that each occur in all seven files?

Consider the seven files: caesar.txt, confucius.txt, errors.txt, hamlet.txt, likeit.txt, macbeth.txt and romeo.txt.
In which file does the word “sea” NOT appear?
(Consider only the exact lowercase string "sea". "SEA" or "sea." would be different words.)
