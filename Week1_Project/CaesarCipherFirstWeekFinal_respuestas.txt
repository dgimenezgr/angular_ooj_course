3. Pregunta 3
Consider the Caesar Cipher two-key algorithm described in this course. Every other character, starting with the first, will use the Caesar Cipher 
algorithm with key1, and every other character, starting with the second, will use the Caesar Cipher algorithm with key2.
Assume shiftedAlphabet1 is the shifted alphabet using key1 and shiftedAlphabet2 is the shifted alphabet using key2, both are of type String.
If i is the location of the current character in the message, and idx is the integer variable of the location of the current character in the 
original alphabet, which one of the following segments of code correctly gets the corresponding encrypted character?

RESPUESTA:
if (i % 2 == 0)  {                 	
     newChar = shiftedAlphabet1.charAt(idx);            
}            
else {                	
     newChar = shiftedAlphabet2.charAt(idx);            
}
